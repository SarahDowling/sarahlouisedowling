Ever since I could talk, I've asked "why". I just had to understand the reasoning and context around everything, and be able to relate it to everything else I understood.
Learning more, making connections, and sharing these new understandings with others drives me as a graphic, UX/UI, and web designer.
I love communicating the way I think — visually.
