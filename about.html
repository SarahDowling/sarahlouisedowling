                <p class="milli push-1-2">Ever since I could talk, I've asked "why". I had to understand the reasoning and context around everything, and be able to relate it to everything else I understood. Learning more, making connections, and sharing these new understandings with others drives me as a graphic interaction and  motion designer. I love communicating the way I think — visually.</p>
                <p class="milli push-1-2">I obtained my Honours Bachelors Degree in Arts and Sciences from the University of Guelph, a degree which focused on creating bridges in thinking, communication, and application between the often separate methodologies of art and science. I will be graduating from Ottawa's Algonquin College Graphic Design program in 2017. At Algonquin, I used my specialties from university — Psychology: Brain and Cognition, and Studio Art — to embrace the challenge of creating cohesive solutions for every project, pairing creativity with logic for these strong and appealing solutions.</p>
