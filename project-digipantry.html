            <p class="milli">Many busy college students today spend more time searching in their kitchen to see what ingredients they have, than actually cooking. This innovative app automatically imports your grocery purchases into a virtual searchable pantry! Hungry? Choose what kind of meal you're looking for, and DigiPantry will only suggest recipes you have the ingredients for. It even automatically removes the ingredients you use after completing a recipe! Save time with DigiPantry, always at your fingertips and ready to help you eat.</p>
