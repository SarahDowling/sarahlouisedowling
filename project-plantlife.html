            <p class="milli push-1-2">This smart planter and app duo both keep you informed on the health of your plants, as well as waters your plants immediately as needed.</p>
            <p class="milli push-1-2">The Plant Life app provides a summary of key health variables (water, temperature, sun, and soil nutrition) providing both a means to keep indoor plants healthy, and a way to learn more about your plantsâ€™ needs.</p>
            <p class="milli push-1-2">Triggered on launch, the Plant Life app assists the user in pairing their Plant Life Smart Planter to their smart device, and assists in confirming plant type for best watering and monitoring/alarm defaults.</p>
            <p class="milli push-0">If the user has yet to purchase on a plant, the built-in directory is able to assist them with choosing a plant to purchase that best fits the environment the user will place it in.</p>
